    <string name="Initial">The carbon footprint of plastic (LDPE or PET, poyethylene) is about 6 kg CO2 per kg of plastic. If we know the weight of our plastic bags, we can multiply it with the number of plastic bags we are using per year. Then we can easily calculate the carbon dioxide emitted by our own usage of plastic bags. See below for some background information:</string>
    <string name="second">o\tThe production of 1 kg of polyethylene (PET or LDPE), requires the equivalent of 2 kg of oil for energy and raw material. Polyethylene PE is the most commonly used plastic for plastic bags.</string>
    <string name="third">o\tBurning 1 kg of oil creates about 3 kg of carbon dioxide in other words: Per kg of plastic, about 6 kg carbon dioxide is created during production and incineration.</string>
    <string name="fourth">o\tA plastic bag has a weight in the range of about 8 g to 60 g depending on size and thickness. For further calculation, it now depends on which weight for a plastic bag you actually use. A common plastic carrying bag as an average weight of 32.5 g.</string>
    <string name="fitht">o\tTake the above relation between kg plastics and kg of carbon dioxide, and you get about 200 g carbon dioxide for 32.5 g of plastic, which is the equivalent of the average plastic carrying bag in our household. Or in other words: For 5 plastic bags we get 1 kg of CO2.</string>

    <string name="Reusablesix">Reusable bags if used on long term will have a lower carbon footprint than the continuous usage of plastic bags, however producing a single reusable bag will have proximately 11 times the CO2 emissions than their plastic counterpart. The previous comes from a study by Edwards, Chris, and Jonna Meyhoff Fry which concluded that a plastic bag must be used 11 times to reach a lower number of carbon Emissions than a plastic bag that was used once:</string>
    <string name="HeaterDetails">Our water heater is one of the most important components of our plumbing system, and ensuring it\'s set to the right temperature will help you stay safe and manage your energy costs.\n\n 48ºC is the minimum safe hot water temperature approved by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A hot water temp of 120 degrees Fahrenheit or 48ºC is adequately hot to keep diseases at bay while allowing steamy hot showers. It will also reduce overall energy and power consumption.\n\n While the maximum temperature for most water heaters is 150 degrees Fahrenheit or 60ºC, The CPSC (Consumer Product Safety Commission) also urges homeowners to adjust the thermostat to 120 degrees Fahrenheit to avoid scalding.\n\n Heating can account for up to two-thirds of your annual energy bills, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). And, on average, heating an American home with natural gas produces about 6,400 pounds of carbon dioxide per year meaning around 56 KG per week. By turning your water heater down to 120˚F it is possible to save about 550 pounds of CO2 a year or about 5 KG per week. Furthermore, it is possible to save around 13% on your electricity bill by reducing your electric hot water heater temperature by 6°C, which is around $54 in savings per year.</string>
